## Description

This is my portfolio! Throughout my career, I'll be updating this webpage to reflect my top accomplishments and achievements as a software and web developer.

Having all of my works and projects on one page makes it easier for recruiters, managers, and, really, anyone to view my work for themselves along with the source code. Since this was my first web page that I've built out by myself, I expect to make many more design changes, optimizations, and updates to the portfolio itself.

## Credits

A very big shout out to Gumbo over on Stack Overflow for solving an initial problem with images in html having padding at the bottom of them. By utilizing vertical-align: bottom; I was able to get rid of the inherent padding on the bottom of images.

A link to the problem can be found here: [Why is there padding at the bottom of my image?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14053952/why-is-there-padding-at-the-bottom-of-my-image)
